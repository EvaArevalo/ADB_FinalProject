Automatically processing natural language inputs and producing language outputs is a key component of Artificial General Intelligence. The ambiguities and noise inherent in human communication render traditional symbolic AI techniques ineffective for representing and analysing language data. Recently statistical techniques based on neural networks have achieved a number of remarkable successes in natural language processing leading to a great deal of commercial and academic interest in the field.   This will be an applied course focussing on recent advances in analysing and generating speech and text using recurrent neural networks. We will introduce the mathematical definitions of the relevant machine learning models and derive their associated optimisation algorithms. The course will cover a range of applications of neural networks in NLP including analysing latent dimensions in text, transcribing speech to text, translating between languages, and answering questions. These topics will be organised into three high level themes forming a progression from understanding the use of neural networks for sequential language modelling, to understanding their use as conditional language models for transduction tasks, and finally to approaches employing these techniques in combination with other mechanisms for advanced applications. Throughout the course the practical implementation of such models on CPU and GPU hardware will also be discussed.   This course will be lead by Phil Blunsom and delivered in partnership with the DeepMind Natural Language Research Group.

Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications, coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved faster and more efficiently than ever before. This course is an entry level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based IBM Watson IoT Platform.  What you will learn:  Quickly create applications that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment, on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data.    What technology is required to complete the course?   The programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.   You will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform, develop and deploy your IoT solution. Your Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card. In order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform. To work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable). Your Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi A USB Keyboard and mouse. Your Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example) There is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi, a pre-flashed SD card, a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit  What prerequisite skills are required ? This is an entry level course, but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required. What additional resources do I need for this course?  The Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform. If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.

Do you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions with data analysis tools? Then Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you, as you learn how to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making. * What do I learn? When you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training exercises.  * Do I need prior knowledge? The course is suitable for (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in the Building Blocks module.  * What literature can I consult to support my studies? You can follow the MOOC without studying additional sources. Further reading of the discussed topics (including the Building Blocks) is provided in the textbook that we wrote and on which the MOOC is based: Econometric Methods with Applications in Business and Economics, Oxford University Press. The connection between the MOOC modules and the book chapters is shown in the Course Guide \\u2013 Further Information \\u2013 How can I continue my studies. * Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course? Staff and PhD students of our Econometric Institute will provide guidance in January and February of each year. In other periods, we provide only elementary guidance. We always advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss topics and exercises. * How will I get a certificate? To gain the certificate of this course, you are asked to make six Test Exercises (one per module) and a Case Project. Further, you perform peer-reviewing activities of the work of three of your fellow learners of this MOOC. You gain the certificate if you pass all seven assignments.

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today\\u2019s job market. Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \\u201cfits together\\u201d to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it. The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module. The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.
