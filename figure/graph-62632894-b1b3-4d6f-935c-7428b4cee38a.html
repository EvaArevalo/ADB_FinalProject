In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.\", directLink: 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning', photoLink: 'https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/ml/large-icon.png', title: 'Machine Learning', tmpId: '0', weekSection: \"[{'name': 'Introduction', 'description': 'Welcome to Machine Learning!

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains. Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as 'data science in action'. The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains. This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments. The course covers the three main types of process mining. 1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log. 2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa. 3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases. Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between 'business' and 'IT'. Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development. The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field. After taking this course you should: - have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining), - understand the role of Big Data in today\\u2019s society, - be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification, - be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools), - be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools), - be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks), - have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project, - be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data, - explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and - be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.\", directLink: 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining', photoLink: 'https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/68f1b0d03511e386f43790e29f1243/dreamstime_l_21055560.jpg', title: 'Process Mining: Data science in Action', tmpId: '25', weekSection: \"[{'name': 'Introduction and Data Mining', 'description': 'This first module contains general course information (syllabus, grading information) as well as the first lectures introducing data mining and process mining.', 'timeCommitment': 19806605, 'id': 'gc843', 'lessonIds': ['4WtNN', 'scPzm', 'qPnTN', 'TMxXi', 'BybQZ', 'Xns7C'], 'slug': 'introduction-and-data-mining'}, {'name': 'Process Models and Process Discovery', 'description': 'In this module we introduce process models and the key feature of process mining: discovering process models from event data.', 'timeCommitment': 13726000, 'id': 'W7glc', 'lessonIds': ['LoZT0', 'odsyX', '5fFjB', 'q8tuw', 'E9JLq', 'n23Zk', 'iifeD'], 'slug': 'process-models-and-process-discovery'}, {'name': 'Different Types of Process Models', 'description': 'Now that you know the basics of process mining, it is time to dive a little bit deeper and show you other ways of discovering a process model from event data.', 'timeCommitment': 10503000, 'id': 'Dzvut', 'lessonIds': ['VEJnw', 'ig1R3', 'viV8E', 'CrarU'], 'slug': 'different-types-of-process-models'}, {'name': 'Process Discovery Techniques and Conformance Checking', 'description': 'In this module we conclude process discovery by discussing alternative approaches.

In part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game 'Asteroids'.  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.  The next course in the specialization will begin to introduce a more principled approach to writing programs and solving computational problems that will allow you to write larger and more complex programs.\", directLink: 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2', photoLink: 'https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera.s3.amazonaws.com/topics/interactivepython/large-icon.png', title: 'An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)', tmpId: '111', weekSection: \"[{'name': 'Week 5 - Mouse input, list methods, dictionaries', 'description': 'Read mouse input, learn about list methods and dictionaries, draw images', 'timeCommitment': 18409000, 'id': 'cBp93', 'lessonIds': ['QKmg9', '3a3Ot', '4DWUD'], 'slug': 'week-5-mouse-input-list-methods-dictionaries'}, {'name': 'Week 6 - Classes and object-oriented programming', 'description': 'Learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python using classes, work with tiled images', 'timeCommitment': 17810000, 'id': 'AZzYe', 'lessonIds': ['iceaL', '6UVh6', 'kcsyW'], 'slug': 'week-6-classes-and-object-oriented-programming'}, {'name': 'Week 7 - Basic game physics, sprites', 'description': '\\tUnderstand the math of acceleration and friction, work with sprites, add sound to your game', 'timeCommitment': 15471000, 'id': 'zLEWs', 'lessonIds': ['wI5NS', 'BRnTm', 'us28C'], 'slug': 'week-7-basic-game-physics-sprites'}, {'name': 'Week 8 - Sets and animation', 'description': 'Learn about sets in Python, compute collisions between sprites, animate sprites', 'timeCommitment': 14310000, 'id': 'wigKt', 'lessonIds': ['Zn3IG', 'MWWnS', 'DCueD', 'KlYRw'], 'slug': 'week-8-sets-and-animation'}]\"})"}, {"id": 800, "label": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b78\u7fd2(2018\u6625\u5b63\u73ed)", "group": "Course", "title": "(_800:Course {description: '', directLink: 'http://www.ewant.org/admin/tool/mooccourse/mnetcourseinfo.php?hostid=6&id=1741', photoLink: 'http://211.76.247.16/mnet/service/enrol/download.php?id=202&area=overviewfiles', title: '\\u6df1\\u5ea6\\u5b78\\u7fd2(2018\\u6625\\u5b63\\u73ed)', tmpId: '327', weekSection: '<p>\\u7b2c1\\u9031:Introduction-\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u4ecb\\u7d39</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c2\\u9031:The Concept of Perceptron-\\u8a8d\\u77e5\\u6982\\u5ff5</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c3\\u9031:Optimal Learning-\\u512a\\u5316\\u5b78\\u7fd2</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c4\\u9031:LMS Learning Algorithm-\\u6700\\u5c0f\\u5747\\u5dee\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u6f14\\u7b97\\u6cd5</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c5\\u9031:The Backpropagation Algorithm-\\u80cc\\u50b3\\u5c0e\\u6f14\\u7b97\\u6cd5</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c6\\u9031: Convolution Neural Network-\\u5377\\u7a4d\\u795e\\u7d93\\u7db2\\u8def</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c7\\u9031:CNN Develop Tools-\\u5377\\u7a4d\\u795e\\u7d93\\u7db2\\u8def\\u958b\\u767c\\u5de5\\u5177</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c8\\u9031:Recurrent Neural Network-\\u5faa\\u74b0\\u795e\\u7d93\\u7db2\\u8def</p><p></p><p>\\u7b2c9\\u9031:RNN Develop Tools RNN-\\u958b\\u767c\\u5de5\\u5177</p><p></p>'})"}, {"id": 401, "label": "11", "group": "Category", "title": "(_401:Category {number: '11'})"}, {"id": 374, "label": "Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra", "group": "Course", "title": "(_374:Course {description: \"In this course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to vectors and matrices.

The course is self-contained, although basic knowledge of elementary set theory, propositional logic, and probability theory would help.

We'll talk about some of its typical applications, such as conceptual clustering and search for implicational dependencies in data. We'll see a few examples of concept lattices and learn how to interpret them. The simplest data structure in formal concept analysis is the formal context. It is used to describe objects in terms of attributes they have. Derivation operators in a formal context link together object and attribute subsets; they are used to define formal concepts. They also give rise to closure operators, and we'll talk about what these are, too. We'll have a look at software called Concept Explorer, which is good for basic processing of formal contexts. We'll also talk a little bit about many-valued contexts, where attributes may have many values.

Participants should complete Parts A and B first -- Part C 'dives right in' and refers often to material from Part A and Part B.] This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language \\u201cfits together\\u201d to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones. This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it. The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module of Part A.  Part B assumes successful completion of Part A. The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows: \\u2022\\tTheory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism \\u2022\\tTask parallelism using Java\\u2019s ForkJoin framework \\u2022\\tFunctional parallelism using Java\\u2019s Future and Stream frameworks \\u2022\\tLoop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking) \\u2022\\tDataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of multicore Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other parallel programming systems that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., C++11, OpenMP, .Net Task Parallel Library).\", directLink: 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java', photoLink: 'https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/76/7060107ddd11e7a14ce99700d553c6/Multicore-logo4.png', title: 'Parallel Programming in Java', tmpId: '250', weekSection: \"[{'name': 'Welcome to the Course!', 'description': 'Welcome to Parallel Programming in Java!
